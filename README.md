# CSC_Outsourcing_Placement_Outcomes
This is a repository of replication files for the upcoming paper, co-authored with Dr Anders Bach-Mortensen and Prof. Jane Barlow, titled 'A longitudinal ecological analysis of the impact of for-profit delivery on placement outcomes among children in care in England 2011-2022'.

This paper is entirely reproducible - with simple R functions to eg. 'create_table_1' published in the repository which directly pull the data - also published in this repository.
